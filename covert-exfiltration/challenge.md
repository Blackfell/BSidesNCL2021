# Example Challenge Text

We noticed some Weird network activity on a workstation, but we can't work out
what was stolen by the attacker. We got absolute proof (PCAPs) that something 
Weird happened, but we need someone to identify the exfiltration channel and
carve out the data to support our investigation.
